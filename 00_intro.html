        <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p>
        	"We think we are creating the system for our own purposes. We believe we are making it in our own image... But the computer is not really like us. It is a projection of a very slim part of ourselves: that portion devoted to logic, order, rule, and clarity." <br>
        	-- Ellen Ullman, <i>Close to the Machine: Technophilia and its Discontents</i>

        	This is a book about instructing computers. Computers are about as common as scrwdrivers today, but they are quite a bit more complex, and making them do what you want them to do isn't always easy.
        </p>
        <p>
        	If the task you have for your computer is a commong, well-understood one, such as showing you your email or acting like a calculator, you can open the appropriate application and get to work. But for unique or open-ended tasks, there probably is no application.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Tha is where programming may come in. <i>Programming</i> is the act of constructing a <i>program</i>-- a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do. Because computers are dumb, pedantic beasts, programming is fundamentally tedious and frustrating.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Fortunately, if you can get over that fact, and maybe even enjoy the rigor of thinking in terms that dunm machines can deal with, programming can be rewarding. It allows you to do things in seconds that would take <i>forever</i> by hand. It is way to make your computer tool do things that it couldn't do before. And it provides a wonderful exercise in abstract thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Most programming is done with programming languages. A <i>programming language</i> is an artificially constructed language used to instruct computers. It is interesting that the most effective way we've found to communicate with a computer borrows so heavily from the way we communicate with each other. Like human languages, computer languages allow words and phrases to be combined in new ways, making it possible to express ever new concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
        	At one point language-based interfaces, such as the BASIC and DOS prompts of the 1980s and 1990s, were the main method of interacting with computers. They have largely been replaced with visual interfaces, which are easier to learn but offer less freedom. Computer languages are still there, if you know where to look. One such language, JavaScript, is built into every modern web brower and is thus available on almost every device.
        </p>
        <p>
        	This book will try to make you familiar enough with this language to do usefull and amusing things with it.

        <h2>ON PROGRAMMING</h2>
        <p>
        	Besides explaining JavaScript, I will introduce the basic principles of programming. Programming, it turns out, is hard. The fundamental rules are simple and clear, but programs built on top of these rules tend to become complex enough to introduce their own rules and complexity. You're building your own maze, in a way, and you might kust get lost in it.
